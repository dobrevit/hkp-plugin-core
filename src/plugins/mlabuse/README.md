- **Parameter Entropy**: Randomness in request parameters
- **Overall Score**: Composite entropy assessment

### LLM/AI Detection

#### Detection Patterns
The plugin identifies AI-generated content through:
- **Perplexity Analysis**: Low perplexity indicates overly predictable text
- **Token Patterns**: Specific phrases and structures common in AI text
- **Formal Language**: Excessive use of formal or academic language
- **Repetitive Structure**: Consistent sentence and paragraph patterns
- **Prompt Injection**: Attempts to manipulate AI systems

#### AI Content Indicators
- Unnaturally perfect grammar and syntax
- Overuse of transitional phrases
- Lack of personal anecdotes or informal language
- Consistent tone without emotional variation
- Technical accuracy combined with generic explanations

## Response Headers

The plugin adds intelligence headers for coordination with other security plugins:

```http
X-ML-Anomaly-Score: 0.923
X-ML-Anomaly-Type: bot_regular
X-ML-LLM-Detected: true
X-ML-Synthetic-Score: 0.812
```

## Integration with Other Plugins

### Rate Limiting Integration
- **Event Subscription**: Listens to `ratelimit.violation` events
- **Profile Updates**: Uses violation data to improve behavioral profiles
- **Escalation**: Can trigger extended bans for persistent abusers
- **Shared Intelligence**: Provides ML scores for informed rate limiting decisions

### Zero Trust Integration
- **Risk Assessment**: ML scores contribute to Zero Trust risk calculations
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Shared behavior data improves trust scoring
- **Authentication Triggers**: High anomaly scores can trigger step-up authentication

### Event System Integration

#### Published Events
- `ml.abuse.detected`: When abuse is detected and blocked
- `ml.abuse.escalate`: When extended ban is recommended

#### Subscribed Events
- `ratelimit.violation`: Rate limiting violations for profile updates

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **Memory Usage**: 50-100MB for models and behavior profiles
- **CPU Impact**: <5% overhead for typical traffic loads
- **Latency**: <10ms processing time per request
- **Model Updates**: Background process, doesn't block requests
- **Disk Usage**: Model files typically 10-50MB

### Scaling Recommendations

#### Small Deployments (<1000 req/min)
- Default configuration suitable
- 2-4 CPU cores recommended
- 4GB RAM minimum

#### Medium Deployments (1000-10000 req/min)
- Consider Redis backend for shared profiles
- 4-8 CPU cores recommended
- 8-16GB RAM for model caching

#### Large Deployments (>10000 req/min)
- Distribute ML processing across instances
- Dedicated ML inference servers
- 8+ CPU cores, 16-32GB RAM per instance

## Best Practices

### Configuration Tuning
1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with higher thresholds (0.9+) and lower gradually
2. **Monitor False Positives**: Track legitimate traffic patterns
3. **Adjust by Traffic Type**: Different thresholds for different endpoint types
4. **Regular Model Updates**: Keep models current with traffic patterns

### Operational Guidelines
1. **Gradual Rollout**: Enable monitoring before enforcement
2. **Baseline Establishment**: Allow learning period before strict enforcement
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically review blocked requests for accuracy
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track resource usage and processing times

### Security Configuration
1. **Model Protection**: Secure model files with appropriate permissions
2. **Log Analysis**: Regular review of detection patterns and effectiveness
3. **Threshold Adjustment**: Adapt thresholds based on threat landscape
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of trained models and configurations

## Troubleshooting

### High False Positive Rate
**Symptoms:**
- Legitimate users being blocked
- High block rate in metrics
- User complaints about access issues

**Solutions:**
- Increase `anomalyThreshold` (e.g., from 0.85 to 0.9)
- Increase `behaviorWindowSize` for more data points
- Review whitelist paths for legitimate automation
- Check if CDN or proxy is affecting behavioral analysis

### Model Performance Issues
**Symptoms:**
- High CPU usage
- Slow response times
- Memory leaks

**Solutions:**
- Reduce `behaviorWindowSize` if memory constrained
- Disable `enableRealtimeUpdate` to prevent model growth
- Increase `updateInterval` to reduce update frequency
- Monitor cleanup intervals and adjust as needed

### Detection Accuracy Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Missing obvious bot traffic
- Inconsistent detection results
- Poor LLM detection accuracy

**Solutions:**
- Lower detection thresholds gradually
- Increase training data through longer observation periods
- Verify model file integrity and version
- Check for sufficient diverse training data

### Integration Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Events not being received
- Headers not appearing
- Plugin conflicts

**Solutions:**
- Verify plugin load order (ML should load after rate limiting)
- Check event subscription setup
- Review middleware registration
- Monitor plugin communication logs

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Detection Rates**: Block rate, false positive rate
2. **Performance**: Processing latency, memory usage
3. **Model Health**: Accuracy metrics, update success rate
4. **System Load**: CPU usage, goroutine counts

### Recommended Alerts
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: high_ml_block_rate
    condition: ml_block_rate > 0.1
    severity: warning
    
  - name: ml_processing_latency
    condition: ml_avg_latency > 50ms
    severity: warning
    
  - name: ml_memory_usage
    condition: ml_memory_mb > 400
    severity: critical
    
  - name: ml_model_update_failure
    condition: ml_update_failures > 3
    severity: critical
```

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
The plugin addresses:
- **Automated Bot Attacks**: Detection through behavioral analysis
- **AI-Generated Spam**: LLM detection capabilities
- **Prompt Injection**: Specific detection for AI manipulation attempts
- **Coordinated Attacks**: Pattern recognition across multiple clients
- **Evasion Attempts**: Adaptive learning to counter sophisticated attackers

### Privacy Considerations
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential behavioral metrics are stored
