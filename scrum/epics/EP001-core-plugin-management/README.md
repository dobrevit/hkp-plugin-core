## API Endpoints to Implement

### Plugin Management
- `GET /plugins/status` - Get overall plugin system status
- `GET /plugins/list` - List all plugins with their status
- `GET /plugins/{plugin-id}/status` - Get specific plugin status
- `POST /plugins/{plugin-id}/reload` - Reload a specific plugin
- `POST /plugins/{plugin-id}/start` - Start a stopped plugin
- `POST /plugins/{plugin-id}/stop` - Stop a running plugin

### Configuration Management
- `GET /plugins/{plugin-id}/config` - Get plugin configuration
- `PUT /plugins/{plugin-id}/config` - Update plugin configuration
- `POST /plugins/{plugin-id}/config/validate` - Validate configuration
- `POST /plugins/{plugin-id}/config/rollback` - Rollback configuration

### Health and Monitoring
- `GET /plugins/health` - Health check for all plugins
- `GET /plugins/{plugin-id}/health` - Health check for specific plugin
- `GET /plugins/{plugin-id}/metrics` - Get plugin-specific metrics
- `GET /plugins/dependencies` - Get dependency graph

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Components
1. **Plugin Registry**: Enhanced with management capabilities
2. **Configuration Manager**: Dynamic configuration handling
3. **Health Monitor**: Continuous health checking
4. **Reload Manager**: Safe plugin reloading
5. **API Controller**: RESTful API implementation

### Performance Requirements
- Plugin status API: <10ms response time
- Plugin reload: <30 seconds for complete reload
- Health monitoring: <5ms per plugin check
