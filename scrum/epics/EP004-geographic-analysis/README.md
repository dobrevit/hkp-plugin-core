## Algorithm Specifications

### Impossible Travel Detection

```
Algorithm: Haversine Distance + Time Analysis

1. Calculate distance between locations using Haversine formula:
   a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos φ1 × cos φ2 × sin²(Δλ/2)
   c = 2 × atan2(√a, √(1−a))
   d = R × c (where R = Earth's radius = 6,371km)

2. Calculate maximum possible speed:
   speed = distance / time_difference

3. Apply thresholds:
   - Commercial aircraft: 900 km/h
   - High-speed rail: 350 km/h
   - Reasonable travel: 1000 km/h (including connections)

4. Consider exceptions:
   - VPN usage patterns
   - Known datacenter IPs
   - User travel patterns
```

### Geographic Clustering

```
Algorithm: DBSCAN with Geographic Distance

1. Use DBSCAN clustering algorithm
2. Distance metric: Haversine distance
3. Parameters:
   - Epsilon: 50km radius
   - MinPoints: 5 IPs
   - Time window: 1 hour
