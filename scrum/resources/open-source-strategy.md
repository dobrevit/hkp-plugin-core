# Open Source Strategy

## Overview

As Hockeypuck is an open source project, we embrace the open source philosophy throughout our development process. This strategy outlines how we leverage open source tools, contribute back to the community, and build a sustainable ecosystem.

## Core Principles

1. **Open Source First**: Always evaluate open source alternatives before commercial tools
2. **Contribute Back**: Share our improvements and tools with the community
3. **Transparency**: Develop in the open with community involvement
4. **Sustainability**: Build a self-sustaining community around the project
5. **Quality**: Open source doesn't mean compromising on quality
